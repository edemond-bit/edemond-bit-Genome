Cmmand line Output description : 
1 ORFs detected by both our program and NCBI annotation as genes
2 Stop codon matched with NCBI, but different start (Multiple start codons)
3 ORFs detected by our program as genes but missed in NCBI annotation
4 ORFs detected in NCBI annotation as genes but missed by our program (missed for some other reasons like gene length (<300), start codon other than ATG, GTG etc
5 ORFs detected in NCBI annotation as genes but predicted as non gene by our program
6 ORFs  predicted as non gene by both our program and NCBI annotation
